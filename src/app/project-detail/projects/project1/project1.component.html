    The bot is easily configurable through a JSON file located in the root of
    the repository.

  <p>
    Discord's API utilizes cogs to group and categorize the different commands.
    These are the cogs which my Discord bot has.

    title="Discord.py v2.0"></app-subsection-heading>

  <p>
    Initially, I used bot commands in discord.py v1.0 to implement the commands.
    However, with the release of discord.py v2.0, I decided to begin migrating
    to use application commands. Application commands offer several benefits,
    including increased stability and better integration with the Discord API.
    However, the migration process is still in progress as I have not yet
    migrated the Music cog.

  <app-subsection-heading
    id="hosting"
    title="EC2 Hosting"></app-subsection-heading>

  <p>
    My discord bot is being hosted on a micro EC2 instance on AWS. This allows
    me to keep the bot running 24/7 without needing to keep my own computer
    running. However, there were some challenges involved in setting up and
    maintaining the instance, such as ensuring the server had enough resources
    to handle to bot's tasks and managing server costs.

    id="lazy-loading"
    title="Lazy Loading"></app-subsubsection-heading>

  <p>
    One notable issue with running the bot on such a small server was storage
    capacity. Essentially, whenever a user would attempt to load a playlist with
    over ~20 songs in it, youtubeDL would need to download all of those songs
    before they could be added to the queue. At best, this would cause the bot
    to timeout and leave the VC, at worst this would cause the server to run out
    of available memory and crash.
  </p>
  <p>
    My solution to this was to implement a form of lazy loading. This involved
    storing the songs in the queue as coroutines which could later be run to
    download the source of the audio. This allowed the bot to queue up playlists
    of 100s of songs while only using the memory it absolutely needed when
    running.
